#Real Time Ticket Management System

#Description
This ticket system is a multithreaded application that designed to vendors to release tickets and customers to buy tickets.Here both customers and vendors
are able to release and buy at same time.They allowed to do actions until the system gets stopped.

#Features
1.CLI - Command Line Interface
    *Here user can configure parameters
    *User can start and stop the system
    *User can exit the system

2.Backend
    *Multi-threaded vendor and customer operations.
    *Synchronized ticket pool management to ensure thread safety.

3.Frontend
    *Layout for parameter configuration and system actions.

4.Error handling
    *Custom exception for invalid inputs.

#System Requirements

1.Java version - JDK 23
2.Javafx version - javafx sdk 23
3.Tools - Intellij/Eclipse/Netbeans

#Setup instruction

1.Clone the repository

*git clone <https://github.com/Gihanks/Real_time_Ticket_System.git>
*cd Real_time_Ticket_System

2.Build the project

*Compile the code using IDE or command line
javac -d bin src/**/*.java

3.Run the Application

*Navigate to the bin directory and start the main program:
java controller.Main

#CLI Commands:

1.Set Configuration:
        *Prompted to enter totalTickets, ticketReleaseRate, customerRetrievalRate, and maxTicketCapacity.
2.Start/Stop System:
        *Start and stop ticketing operations via options in the CLI.
3.Show Status:
        *Check the current number of tickets in the pool.

#Technical Details
1.Backend Logic
    *Producer-Consumer Pattern:
        Vendors and customers operate as threads.
        TicketPool is a shared resource synchronized to prevent race conditions.

    *Custom Exception Handling:
        Handles invalid inputs and vendor-related issues.

    *Concurrency Mechanisms:
            Utilizes BlockingQueue and synchronized blocks for thread safety.

#Limitations
    *Requires manual setup for now; automation scripts can be added.

#Known Issues
    *High Thread Activity: May occur if ticket rates are misconfigured. Ensure proper values during setup.
    *Unresponsive GUI: Not functional currently; CLI is the fallback.
